## Summary of Findings

The total sales of Wallmart for the year from 2011 - 2014 is $2348.49K and the Total Profit and the Total Revenue was $ 283.24K and $ 11982.98K respectively. 

The Total Quantity of all the sold items was around 30K and there were 792 individual customers throughout these 3 years.

The Target, which had been set to the 10 % of the total sales hadn't reached out on those 3 years. 

The most of the sales were from Central Region then there was almost similar amount of sales were in South and Northern Region. The maximum of sales came from the 'Consumers', then 'Corporates' and 'Home Office sales' respectively. If we dig into deeper we can see
apart from the overall sales in overall categories (which is maximum in Central Region for all the categories), we can see for the category Technology and Furniture, The sales in North is high by a bit than the Sales in South, but the Sales of Office Supplies is a bit high in South than the North.

The maximum product had been sold is Bookcases. Also the Top 5 products which were sold maximum in quantities are 1. Bookcases, 2. Phones, 3. Copiers, 4. Storage and 5. Appliances.
The least product that sold were Labels.

The maximum shipments are of 'Economy' class and the businesses are done mostly in the weekdays. We can see the total sales throughout the weekdays in these 3 years is  around $ 2063K whereas in the weekend only $285.4K has been done.

The most profitable product was been - Nokia Smart Phone Full Size.
The most sold product was been - Dania Corner Shelving, Traditional.

Mostly the customers are from France then there comes Germany and UK respectively. And the name of the top 1 customer by sales was 
"Angie Massengill" and the top 1 customer by the amount of quantity purchased was "Summer Hayward".  

Then at last from the KPI view, it is clearly shown that there was an ultimate failure to reach the target point of sales.
The company was failed to reach the Goal by 9.09% in those 3 years.


## Suggestions

If the company want to reach their desired Target, they've to work into some key factors which may increase their sales.

1. They should focus more on introducing themselves, advertising more and maybe putting some exciting offers on products or via digital marketing on the other regions also ie. South and Northern region. Also increasing the supply to meet all the demands from Central region. 

2. They can bring up the sales by bringing up the market of Technology and Furniture in North. Also making more availability of the office supplies in South can be really helpful.

3. They should keep focusing on the mostly sold products (Top 10 atleast) to the respected places. And should process the shippings in less charge for the other classes also.

4. They should more focus on the countries like France, Germany etc to bring up their sales.
